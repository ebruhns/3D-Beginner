# 410 Assignment 2
Brenna Stutenroth, Ellie Bruhns, and Shane Folden


## Division of Labor
- Brenna did player Part 1, player Part 2, and the particle effect.
- Ellie did environment, camera, ending the game, audio, and the linear interpolation element.
- Shane did enemy 1, enemy 2, and the dot product element.

## Dot Product Element
To view the dot product element in the game, walk near any of the gargoyles in the map. The nearest one is in the top left of the room you spawn in.
The gargoyle will rotate his position to face the player, which is done using a dot product to calculate the correct angle.

## particle effect
The particle effect I created can be seen at the foot of our player, John Lemon.  These
particles circle around him, and will move with the character.

## interpolate element
The interpolate element uses color lerp and math lerp to change the colors of the ghost materials. The colors cycle from red, blue, green, pink, yellow, orange and white.
